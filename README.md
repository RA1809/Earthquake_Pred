# Earthquake_Pred

Earthquakes are natural disasters that can cause significant damage and loss of life. Accurate prediction of earthquakes is essential for developing early warning systems, disaster planning, risk assessment, and scientific research. This project aims to predict the magnitude and probability of earthquakes occurring in a particular region, specifically California, United States, using machine learning models.

<h3>Dataset</h3>
The dataset contains information about earthquakes that have occurred with a magnitude of 3.0 or greater in California, United States between 1999 and 2022.
Each row in the dataset represents a single earthquake event, including details such as the latitude and longitude of the epicenter, depth, magnitude, and other relevant attributes.

<h3>Code Environment</h3>

You can run the code on google colab notebook after importing the libraries as mentioned in the code.The Earthquake_Data file needs to be uploaded before running the code.In case the path changes, we need to modify it in the line 
df = pd.read_csv('/content/Earthquake_Data.csv'
